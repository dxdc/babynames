# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-22

Project audit — data quality, pronunciation fixes, nickname support, territory data.

### Pipeline

- **Nickname relationships** — new `nickname_of` and `nicknames` columns link names to their formal forms (Matt → Matthew, Liz → Elizabeth). Curated mappings in `raw/nicknames.csv`. Informational only — counts stay separate.
- **Pronunciation overrides** (`raw/pronunciation_overrides.csv`) — correct CMU dictionary errors that cause incorrect groupings. Fixes: Jere ≠ Jerry, Hugh ≠ Yu, Charron ≠ Karen, Tsai ≠ Cy.
- **US territory data** — pipeline now loads SSA territory files (Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, etc.) from `raw/territories/` and merges into national totals.
- **Expanded excluded names** — added Infantof, Infantboy, Infantgirl, Infantmale, Infantfemale, Newborn, Noname, Unborn, Infboy, Wm, Jr to the filter list. Boy and Girl are kept as legitimate names.
- **~115 forced merges** — double/single consonant splits (Jenifer→Jennifer, Hanah→Hannah), vowel ending variants (Colten→Colton, Helyn→Helen), ph/f substitutions (Christofer→Christopher, Jennipher→Jennifer, Josefine→Josephine), Jay/Ja variants (Jaymes→James), and more. Round 2 added ~45 merges targeting high-count typos (Johnn→John, Michaell→Michael, Wiliam→William, etc.) identified by the diagnostic script.
- **Diagnostic script** (`scripts/find_missing_merges.py`) — reusable tool to detect candidate missing merges by applying substitution patterns. Run after SSA data updates.
- Fixed `classify_unisex_names` dominant gender calculation to be explicit rather than relying on dict iteration order.
- Fixed inconsistent `.get()` vs direct indexing in `merge_spelling_variants`.

### Frontend

- **Grid sorting fix** — added missing `sorter` property to Nickname Of, Biblical, and all hidden columns (Letter, Palindrome, Stresses, Phones, Alliteration). Clicking these column headers now sorts correctly.
- **Nickname Of tooltip** — column now shows comma-separated names with a hover/tap tooltip for overflow, matching the Variations column behavior.
- **Variations column** — tooltip now always shows on hover (not just when >5 names), and display always uses comma separation.

### Tests

- 110 tests (was 57) — added coverage for forced merges, pronunciation overrides, nickname loading, Jr-suffix stripping, excluded names, biblical categories, subword splitting, and syllable estimation.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-22

Swipe mode for couples, sharing, and a bunch of polish.

### Swipe Mode

New full-screen overlay for reviewing names one at a time — swipe right to like, left to pass, up for maybe. Works with touch drag, mouse drag, tap buttons, or arrow keys.

- Choose how deep to go before starting (Top 100 / 500 / 1000 / All) with time estimates
- Multi-select spelling variants on each card (tap to toggle preferred spellings)
- Card badges for quick visual ID: 📖 Biblical (category), 📈 Trending, 🕰️ Classic, ⚤ Unisex, 🔁 Palindrome, 🔤 Alliteration
- Progress bar with running ♥/★ counts, undo (Ctrl+Z), Escape to close
- Swipe down to dismiss on mobile
- Simplified intro screen — just pick scope, enter name, go
- Session auto-saved to localStorage; resume where you left off

### Sharing & Comparison

Everyone is a peer — no "host" or "admin." Anyone can share at any time.

- **Share My Picks**: generates a URL with your name, gender, and liked/maybe ranks
- **Add Someone's Picks**: paste a link to load a partner's, grandparent's, or friend's picks
- **Comparison view**: groups matches as "Everyone loves" / "Strong contenders" / "Worth discussing"
- **Individual voter details**: expandable section showing each person's picks with remove button
- Gender validation: warns if someone shared boys picks but you're viewing girls
- Self-import protection: won't add your own picks as another voter
- Export to CSV (opens in Excel/Sheets), import from CSV or JSON
- Share as image: generates a PNG with your picks for texting

### Web UI

- Custom domain: `baby.dxdc.dev`
- Custom OG image for social sharing previews (Twitter Card, JSON-LD structured data)
- Nav with inline SVG icons (GitHub, download arrows), footer with source/feedback/donate links
- PWA manifest for "Add to Home Screen" on mobile
- Mobile table hides overflow columns cleanly instead of collapsing into sub-rows
- Improved contrast in light/dark mode (visible borders, darker chip backgrounds, stronger muted text)
- Card shadow, button press/glow animations, screen fade transitions, completion bounce
- Year filter input disabled until a mode is selected
- Cache-busting version param on CSV URLs
- Screen reader announcements for card changes, actions, and completion

### Pipeline

- Forced spelling merges (`raw/forced_merges.csv`) — 210 manual overrides for names the phonetic algorithm splits incorrectly (Kaitlyn/Katelyn/Caitlin, Caleb/Kaleb, Jason/Jayson, Brooklyn/Brooklynn, etc.)
- Biblical names now categorized: Person, Place, God, Other (was boolean). Shows category in table and swipe card badges.
- Expanded biblical names list with missing entries (Elizabeth, Timothy, Ethan, Elijah, etc.) and BibleNLP cross-reference
- Excluded junk names from SSA data: Unknown, Infant, Male, Female, Babyboy, Babygirl, Childnotnamed, Nogivenname, Nonamegiven, Notnamed, Unnamed
- Unisex recency cutoff derived from data (`max_year - 50`) instead of hardcoded 1970

### Infrastructure

- `biblical` CSV column changed from `1`/empty to category string: `Person`, `Place`, `God`, `Other`, or empty
- Pages workflow deploys only `_site/` directory (was shipping entire 41MB repo)
- Generate workflow queues instead of cancelling on rapid pushes
- Pages auto-redeploys after successful data generation
- Added `permissions: contents: write` to generate workflow
- Fixed CRLF line endings in test files
- Added `.prettierignore` for data/raw/images

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-21

Ground-up rewrite of the data pipeline, web viewer, and project infrastructure. **The CSV schema has changed** — see [Breaking Changes (v2.0)](#breaking-changes-v20) below.

### Added

- **12 interactive filters** with URL hash state for shareable links: gender, name search, rank, syllables, name length, peak decade, year filter (4 modes), starting letter (multi-select), unisex threshold, variants, and traits (biblical, trending, palindrome, alliteration)
- **Virtual scrolling** through all ~39k boys / ~60k girls names (Tabulator virtual DOM)
- **Dark mode** with full theme persistence
- **Gender-aware accent colors** — blue for boys, pink for girls across all UI controls
- **Data info bar** — shows loaded gender, name count, and year range
- **Polars-based pipeline** replacing pandas/swifter for faster processing
- **Best-cluster pronunciation grouping** — prevents multi-pronunciation names from bridging unrelated families
- **g2p_en neural model** (optional) — pronounces names not in CMU dict; used for display/syllables only, not grouping
- **Spelling-based syllable fallback** for names without any pronunciation
- **`unisex_pct`** — minority gender share (0–50%) replacing the old boolean flag
- **`unisex_dominant`** — which gender is dominant (M/F)
- **`is_palindrome`**, **`alliteration`** (any repeated phoneme), **`alliteration_first`** columns
- **Spelling variants sorted by popularity** (most common first), truncated in UI with tooltip
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** — linting, tests, auto-regeneration of CSVs/graph, auto-deploy to Pages
- **57-test suite** covering pipeline, phonetics, and output validation
- **Distribution graph** auto-generated with 90%/95% threshold annotations
- **SSA data through 2024**

### Changed

- Web UI: Bootstrap + Grid.js → Pico CSS + Tabulator 6.4
- Pipeline: pandas/pronouncing → Polars + direct cmudict with subword splitting
- Trending filter is now relative (last 15 years of data) instead of hardcoded
- Year filter simplified to single dropdown with four clear modes
- `pyproject.toml` replaces `requirements.txt`
- Web viewer moved from `docs/` to project root
- CSVs moved from project root to `data/`
- Source data moved from `src/data/babynames/` to `raw/`

### Breaking Changes (v2.0)

**File layout:**

| v1.x                              | v2.0                              |

| `src/requirements.txt`            | `pyproject.toml`                  |
